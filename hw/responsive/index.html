      <p> This is a website about me, Buddy Barger! I am a 13 year old golden retriever who is very kind and goofy. I love every single person I meet and am amazed how people already know my name before they even meet me! I spend a lot of time playing at home, going on walks, and driving around with my family! You may also recognize me from the movie <em>Snow Buddies</em> where I played both B-Dog and Rosebud.</p>

        <h4 id="likesanddislikes"> Likes & Dislikes</h4>
        <p> <strong> <em>Likes:</em> </strong> I really enjoy hanging by the pool but in the shade. I love cuddling with my family: Julia, Jenny, Glenn, and Sandy! I love when my family cooks for me (especilly hot dogs)! Although I don't love long walks, short ones around my neighborhood are so fun! I love when people pet me and when all the attention is on me! I love going to the beach with my family and walking around but never going into the water! <br> <br> <strong> <em>Dislikes</em> </strong> I fell into the pool one too many times as a puppy so I do not like swimming or when my family swims either because it scares me. I do not like when my whole family is not home because I prefer we all be together! I like driving but not when Sandy is the driver. I do not like the vaccuum that moves around on its own. I love when we have visitors at our house but do not like when the visitors are not petting me. I really like skunks but not when they spray me. </p>

        <p> I have many hobbies! To start, I love to jump around and wag my tail very hard against solid materials when I know I am about to eat! Another hobby I love is wrestling with my family members, we jump on each other and it is so fun! I love sitting at the bottom of the stairs because I can easily know where everyone is! My favorite hobby that I am very very good at is looking extremely cute to get people to come and pet me! </p>
