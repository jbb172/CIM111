						<h1 id="diddy">Diddy Riese</h1>
						<p id="riese">Diddy Riese is located in the heart of Westwood. It is cheap, delicious, and a los angeles staple! It is great for college students due to its inexpensive price, its close proximity to UCLA, and it is open much later than most places as its hours are from 11am-12pm. The cookies are very high quality and the icecream is Dreyers! For those who do not love cookies, icecream, or are allergic to dairy there is the option to get shaved ice instead! Being a very popular spot in LA, be ready to wait in a long line but it is all worth it when you get your dessert!</p>
