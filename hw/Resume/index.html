  <h7> My name is Julia Barger and I am a nineteen year old from Los Angeles. I go to the University of Miami where I am a Communication Studies major with a minor in both Marketing and Music Business. I love exploring and doing things with my friends and family such as hiking, hanging out at the beach, and going out to eat. I hope to one day work in the music world on the business side. </h7>
